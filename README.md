# Technologies Used

## Languages Used

[CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)

[Python](https://www.python.org/)

## Frameworks, Libraries and Programmes Used 

[GitHub](https://github.com/) - Holds the repository of my project, GitHub connects to GitPod and Heroku.

[GitPod](https://gitpod.io/workspaces) â€“ Connected to GitHub, GitPod hosted the coding space, allowing the project to be built and then committed to the GitHub repository. 

[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) - Connected to the GitHub repositiry, Heroku is a cloud application platform used to deploy this project so the backend language can be utilised/tested. 

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) - This framework was used to build the foundations of this project, reducing time spent geting the project setup and prevent re-writing existing code.

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Used to quickly add design to my website, Bootstrap focuses on mobile first design meaning this website is responsive across multiple devices ans screen sizes. 

[Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Rbrand&utm_content=492438439811&utm_term=cloudinary&gclid=Cj0KCQiAt8WOBhDbARIsANQLp96hTerzfFJ_P9lX0tEYEdtM3tSsYB6fhw-x3wQxOO0oc4hXm-A2ZBUaAptIEALw_wcB) - Used to store images online for the recipe posts. 


# Testing

## Functionality 

The project follows the below logic: 

<img src="assets/images/logic_flow_chart.png" height="350px"> 


I have manually tested the projecy by:



# Validator Testing

The code was validated using [PEP8](http://pep8online.com/). No errors were retruned. 

# Bugs Found 


# Deployment 

This project was deployed using the Code Institutes mock terminal for Heroku. 

I followed the following steps:
1. Login to Heroku and Create a New App.

2. Give the App a name, it must be unique, and select a region. 

<img src="assets/images/heroku_deployment_2.png" height="180px"> 

3. Click on 'Create App'. This will take you to a page where you can deploy your project. 

4. Click on 'Settings' among the tabs at the top of the page. The following sets must be dione before deployment.

5. Next, scroll down to Config Vars (also knownas Environment Variables). In order for Heroku to access my spreadsheet it must have access to the contents of the creds.json file. As this file is to be kept secure it cannot be found in my GitHub repository. To enable access securely, sensitive data is stored in a Config Vars. 

<img src="assets/images/heroku_deployment_4.png" height="120px"> 

6. Click 'Reveal Config Vars'. Where it says 'KEY', input CREDS and 'VALUE', input the contents of the creds.json file. Then click 'ADD'. 
I also had to add a second Config Vars of KEY: PORT and VALUE: 8000, to improve compatability with the Code Institute [Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/python-essentials-template) I am using.

7. Scroll down to Buildpacks. This adds futher required dependencies outside of the requirements.txt file. Click 'Add Buildpack', select 'python' first and then click 'Save Changes'. 
Then, add a second Buildpack, 'nodejs', to handle the mock terminal provided by The Code Institute.

**The order of these Buildpacks is intentional, ensure Python is on top and nodejs underneath. The order can be changed by clicking and dragging.**

8. Go to the 'Deploy' section using the tabs at the top. Find the 'Deployment Method' section and choose GitHub. Then, I connected to my relevant GitHub Repository by searching the repository name and clicking 'Connect'.

9. Scroll down to the Automatic and Manual Deploys sections. I have enabled Automatic Deploys as I want my project to automatically redeploy if push any changes back into my repository. I then clicked 'Deploy Branch' in the Manual Deploy section and waited as Heroku installed all dependencies and deployed my code.

10. Once my code was finished deploying I clicked view, to see my newly deployed project in the terminal.
